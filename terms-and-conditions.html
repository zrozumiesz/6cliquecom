            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> These Terms are between you (the End-User) and 6Clique only, not

                    code of, modify, or create derivative
                    works of the 6Clique app, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the
                    extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law).</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance and Support:</strong> We are solely responsible for any maintenance or support.
                    Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to
                    the 6Clique Application.</li>
                <li><strong>Warranty:</strong> There is no warranty. You expressly acknowledge that use of 6Clique is at
                    your own sole risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, 6Clique and any services
                    performed or provided by 6Clique are provided "as is" and "as available" with no faults and without
                    warranty of any kind. You hereby disclaim all warranties and conditions with respect to 6Clique,
                    either express, implied, or statutory, including, but noit limited to, the implied warranties and
                    or/conditions of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, of
                    accuracy, of quiet enjoyment, and of noninfringement of third-party rights. No oral or written
                    information or advice given shall create a warranty.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Claims:</strong> 6Clique LLC is responsible for addressing claims regarding the
                    6Clique application’s use, compliance, or regulatory requirements. To the extent not prohibited by
                    applicable law, this includes, but is not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) claims that
                    the 6Clique application fails to meet any applicable legal or regulatory requirements; and (iii)
                    claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar laws, including in connection with the
                    6Clique application’s use of Apple’s HealthKit and HomeKit frameworks.</li>

                <li><strong>Limitation of Liability: </strong>To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall
                    6Clique LLC be liable for personal injury or any incidental, special, indirect, or consequential
                    damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of data,
                    business interruption, or any other commercial damages or losses, arising out of or related to your
                    use of or inability to use the 6Clique application, however caused, regardless of the theory of
                    liability (contract, tort, or otherwise) and even if 6Clique LLC has been advised of the possibility
                    of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for personal injury, or
                    of incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you. In no event shall
                    6Clique LLC’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable
                    law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing
                    limitations will apply even if the above-stated remedy fails of its essential purpose. </li>
                <li><strong>Intellectual Property Rights:</strong> We are solely responsible for addressing any
                    third-party intellectual property claims. 6Clique LLC, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the
                    investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement
                    claim. </li>

                    supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or
                    restricted parties. </li>

                    comply with all applicable terms, rules, and policies of any Third-Party Services you access through

                    control these services and is not liable for any loss, claim, or damage arising from your use of
                    them. You agree not to use any Third-Party Services in violation of their terms, to infringe on the
                    rights of others, or to harass, abuse, or harm other users. You are solely responsible for ensuring
                    your use of Third-Party Services complies with applicable laws, regulations, and third-party
                    policies.</p>

                <li><strong>Third-Party Beneficiary:</strong> Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries
                    of these Terms and may enforce them.</li>
