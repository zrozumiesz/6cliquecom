                six.

                <p>6Clique connects you with five other people based on your psychological compatibility in a small,
                    safe group
                    where you can share honestly and feel truly known. </p>
                <p>For six days, you answer one thoughtful reflection each day. At night, your group's
                    answers are shared anonymously among one another. </p>
                <p>This is where real conversation begins.
                    No swiping. No endless scrolling. No small talk. Just real conversations that matter.

                <p>
                    Friendship shouldn't feel impossible.</p>
                <p> In a world where loneliness is prevalent, superficiality is
                    rewarded, and time moves too fast,
                    genuine friendships can feel out of reach. </p>
                <p>6Clique helps you form meaningful connections and gain real emotional support through shared
                    experiences.
                    Its unique design fosters trust and empathy in intimate groups, helping you grow both emotionally
                    and socially.

                <h2>Why Depth over Dopamine?</h2>
                <p>
                    We live in a social media-centric world, but the platforms we have are cruel.
                    They're engineered for addiction, driven by likes and followers, and obsessed with appearances.</p>
                <p>6Clique is a social media app for people who crave authenticity over dopamine.
                    It's built for emotional mirroring, raw honesty, and slow introspection —
                    the opposite of a feed built to keep you scrolling. </p>
                <p>Because connection isn’t about numbers — it’s about real engagement.
                    Our app’s name hints at exclusivity, but the experience is anything but.
                    Everyone’s welcome to belong.

            <div class="faq-question">How do daily reflections work?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>If you’ve opted into notifications, you’ll receive a new daily reflection question at
                    <strong>6 AM Central Time</strong>. You have until <strong>6 PM Central</strong> to respond
                    (500-character limit).
                </p>
                <p>At <strong>8 PM Central</strong>, our server gathers all responses from your group members
                    and posts them—<em>anonymously and in random order</em>—into each group chat you’re part of,
                    bundled into a single message.
                </p>
                <p>If a particular anonymous response resonates with you, you can spend <strong>3 leaves</strong>
                    to reveal the author and connect more personally. This often sparks deeper, more meaningful
                    conversations within the group.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes — you’re always in control of your participation.
                You can leave or end your session at any time without disrupting others.
                Messages you’ve already sent will remain visible until the group naturally expires (6 days after it
                starts).
                Twenty days after the group closes, all related group data is permanently deleted from our servers.

                <p>You can report any content that feels unsafe or inappropriate at any time. This includes profiles
                    (tap the flag icon at the top right), messages (long-press), or comments and journal entries (use
                    the three-dot menu). You can also block specific users to prevent them from contacting you. Our
                    moderators review reports promptly, usually within 7 days. If harmful behavior is confirmed, the
                    user may receive a warning or have their account removed to keep the community safe.</p>
