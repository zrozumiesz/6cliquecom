            <h1>The New-Age Social App for Meaningful Connection</h1>
            <p>Social media is broken. It rewards the fake, the filtered, and the performative.
                6Clique is the most intimate social experience yet — offering deep connection in microcommunities of
                six.
                Share your thoughts through shared journals, daily reflections, and authentic conversations.
                Built for depth, not dopamine.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                6Clique connects you with five other people based on your emotional alignment in a small, safe group
                where
                you can share honestly and feel
                truly known. For six days, you answer one thoughtful reflection each day. At night, your group's answers
                are
                shared anonymously among one another.
                This is where real conversation begins.
                No swiping. No endless scrolling. No small talk. Just real conversations that matter.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Value</h2>
            <p>
                Friendship shouldn't feel impossible. In a world where loneliness is prevalent, superficiality is
                rewarded,
                and time moves too fast,
                genuine friendships can feel out of reach.
                6Clique helps you form meaningful connections and gain real emotional support through shared
                experiences.
                Its unique design fosters trust and empathy in intimate groups, helping you grow both emotionally and
                socially.

            <h2>Why 6Clique?</h2>
            <p>
                We live in a social media-centric world, but the platforms we have are cruel.
                They're engineered for addiction, driven by likes and followers, and obsessed with appearances.
                6Clique is a social media app for people who crave depth over dopamine.
                It's built for emotional mirroring, raw honesty, and slow introspection —
                the opposite of a feed built to keep you scrolling.
                Because connection isn’t about numbers — it’s about depth.
                Our app’s name hints at exclusivity, but the experience is anything but.
                Everyone’s welcome to belong.
