        <h1 class="hero-title">I Left a Note on a Bulletin Board</h1>

        <p>In 2023, I taped up a handwritten note on a bulletin board by a café. It said: “I’m lonely, and it’s
            suffocating. Help me.”</p>

        <p>I put my contact information at the bottom, tore off little slips like people do with guitar lessons or
            roommate ads, and left.</p>

        <p>No one ever reached out. A week later, my note was taken down.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>On paper, loneliness wasn’t supposed to be my story.</p>

        <p>I had friends I saw every week. Good friends — loyal, empathetic, kind, and loving. I wasn’t isolated, and I
            wasn’t unloved.</p>

        <p>And before anyone assumes — no, it wasn’t about romance either. I wasn’t invisible. I was in my early
            twenties, living in the city. On dating apps, I had plenty of matches. If anything, I had too many
            surface‑level conversations.</p>

        <p>But the truth is this: despite being surrounded by people, even people who genuinely loved me, I was
            drowning in loneliness.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>What I needed wasn’t more small talk. Not more daily recaps of “work was fine” or “traffic was bad.” Not more
            swipes, emojis, or half‑hearted “wyd?” texts. Not even the juicy gossip on neighbors or celebrities.</p>

        <p>I needed a place where someone would actually ask me the questions that mattered:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>When was the last time you asked for help when you needed it?</li>
            <li>What do you need from others to feel safe in opening up?</li>
            <li>What do we need to know for you to feel truly understood?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But no one asked.</p>

        <p>And so I slipped deeper into a cycle of silence — showing up with a smile, playing the role I thought I was
            meant to play, laughing at the right moments, nodding at the right stories. But I was too scared to be
            myself. I was doing everything I could to enhance my likeability, not my authenticity.</p>

        <p>At night, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, my life felt so hollow I wanted to crawl out of my own
            skin.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I made 6Clique for the modern loneliness epidemic.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t an abstract startup idea. It was a lifeline I built for myself — the kind of place I desperately
            needed but couldn’t find.</p>

        <p>6Clique is designed to create the conversations that never seem to happen on their own. It gives you 365
            questions, one for each day of the year. Each one of them came from my own sleepless, lonely nights — the
            questions I once wished someone would ask me.</p>

        <p>Instead of throwing you into an endless feed of strangers, it carefully places you in a small group of six
            people with a similar emotional alignment. Every night, each group's reflections to the questions are posted
            into the chat – but with no names attached. Between the questions, you have the chance to reflect together
            and support one another for all our fears, dreams, shame, and joy. For six days, you have the chance to peel
            back the mask, drop the act, and experience what happens when we dare to go deeper. For some of us, it can
            be deeper than we ever have experienced before.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I don’t believe in shallow people. I believe all of us fundamentally crave depth. That's what it means to
            be human. Loneliness doesn’t come from lack of people — it comes from lack of connection. The right
            environment can change everything.</p>

        <p>6Clique is that environment, where every person matters equally. It brews the perfect conditions for
            authenticity — not with pressure, but with structure. Not with algorithms for likes and followers, but with
            space for presence. It maintains our human dignity without forming hierarchy.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I don’t know who will find this or how far it will go.</p>

        <p>But I do know this: No one should ever have to tape a note to a café wall begging for connection, only to
            be met with silence. 6Clique exists so none of us have to.</p>
