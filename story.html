        <h1 class="hero-title">About the Founder</h1>
        <p>My name is Amy, and I’m the solo founder of 6Clique. I’m 24 years old, a distributed systems engineer by
            trade, and—at the time of writing this—34 weeks pregnant with my first daughter.</p>
        <p>The idea for 6Clique was born out of a kind of loneliness I wouldn’t wish on anyone. After my first and
            only miscarriage, I found myself in a world that felt unbearably quiet. I longed for someone who could
            truly see me—not in a surface-level way, but in the kind of deep, grounding way that reminds you you’re
            not alone in this world.</p>
        <p>The truth is, loneliness wasn’t new to me. Growing up, I learned to protect myself by hiding behind a
            mask—keeping things light, avoiding vulnerability, pretending to be fine even when I wasn’t. Trauma
            taught me that being honest about my pain might drive people away. So I became good at keeping it all
            inside.</p>
        <p>At my lowest point, I taped a handwritten note to a café bulletin board asking for connection. Hell,
            begging for someone to understand. It was taken down quickly, but the feeling behind it never left me.
        </p>
        <p>In many ways, 6Clique is my answer to that note. I wanted to create a space that doesn’t just skim the
            surface, but invites people into real, emotionally honest friendships. The kind of connections where you
            don’t have to pretend to be okay, where silence can feel safe, and where you can share the truth of who
            you are without fear of being dismissed.</p>
        <p>I know firsthand how easy it is to feel invisible—even when surrounded by people. I also know how
            life-giving it is to finally feel understood. 6Clique was built for anyone who craves that deeper
            intimacy in friendship, whether you’re going through heartbreak, grief, transition, or simply tired of
            small talk. And while it was born from my loneliness, I’ve seen that it resonates with people who aren’t
            lonely at all—people who just want more authenticity in their friendships.</p>
        <p>My background is in engineering, where my work has been all about building systems that don’t fail under
            pressure. But this project is different—it’s about building spaces where people don’t have to carry
            their pressure alone. Every feature, from group chats to journals to daily reflections, was designed
            with one question in mind: what makes people feel emotionally safe and seen?</p>
        <p>I don’t believe in quick fixes for loneliness, but I do believe in creating environments where intimacy
            can grow naturally. 6Clique is my way of holding the door open to anyone who, like me, has ever felt the
            ache of wanting someone to really know them.</p>
        <p>If you’ve ever felt that ache, I hope you find in 6Clique what I once went searching for: a place where
            real connection begins.</p>
            <br>

        <h1 class="hero-title">The Story Behind 6Clique</h1>

        <p>In 2023, I taped up a handwritten note on a bulletin board by a café. It said: “I’m lonely, and it’s
            suffocating. Help me.”</p>

        <p>I put my contact information at the bottom, tore off little slips like people do with guitar lessons or
            roommate ads, and left.</p>

        <p>No one ever reached out. A week later, my note was taken down.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>On paper, loneliness wasn’t supposed to be my story.</p>

        <p>I had friends I saw every week. Good friends — loyal, empathetic, kind, and loving. I wasn’t isolated, and I
            wasn’t unloved.</p>

        <p>And before anyone assumes — no, it wasn’t about romance either. I wasn’t invisible. I was in my early
            twenties, living in the city. On dating apps, I had plenty of matches. If anything, I had too many
            surface‑level conversations.</p>

        <p>But the truth is this: despite being surrounded by people, even people who genuinely loved me, I was
            drowning in loneliness.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>What I needed wasn’t more small talk. Not more daily recaps of “work was fine” or “traffic was bad.” Not more
            swipes, emojis, or half‑hearted “wyd?” texts. Not even the juicy gossip on neighbors or celebrities.</p>

        <p>I needed a place where someone would actually ask me the questions that mattered:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><i>When was the last time you asked for help when you needed it?</i></li>
            <li><i>What do you need from others to feel safe in opening up?</i></li>
            <li><i>What do we need to know for you to feel truly understood?</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>But no one asked.</p>

        <p>And so I slipped deeper into a cycle of silence — showing up with a smile, playing the role I thought I was
            meant to play, laughing at the right moments, nodding at the right stories. But I was too scared to be
            myself. I was doing everything I could to enhance my likeability, not my authenticity.</p>

        <p>At night, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, my life felt so hollow I wanted to crawl out of my own
            skin.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I made 6Clique for the modern loneliness epidemic.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t an abstract startup idea. It was a lifeline I built for myself — the kind of place I desperately
            needed but couldn’t find.</p>

        <p>6Clique is designed to create the conversations that never seem to happen on their own. It gives you 365
            questions, one for each day of the year. Each one of them came from my own sleepless, lonely nights — the
            questions I once wished someone would ask me.</p>

        <p>Instead of throwing you into an endless feed of strangers, it carefully places you in a small group of six
            people with a similar emotional alignment. Every night, each group's reflections to the questions are posted
            into the chat – but with no names attached. Between the questions, you have the chance to reflect together
            and support one another for all our fears, dreams, shame, and joy. For six days, you have the chance to peel
            back the mask, drop the act, and experience what happens when we dare to go deeper. For some of us, it can
            be deeper than we ever have experienced before.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I don’t believe in shallow people. I believe all of us fundamentally crave depth. That's what it means to
            be human. Loneliness doesn’t come from lack of people — it comes from lack of connection. The right
            environment can change everything.</p>

        <p>6Clique is that environment, where every person matters equally. It brews the perfect conditions for
            authenticity — not with pressure, but with structure. Not with algorithms for likes and followers, but with
            space for presence. It maintains our human dignity without forming hierarchy.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I don’t know who will find this or how far it will go.</p>

        <p>But I do know this: No one should ever have to tape a note to a café wall begging for connection, only to
            be met with silence. 6Clique exists so none of us have to.</p>
